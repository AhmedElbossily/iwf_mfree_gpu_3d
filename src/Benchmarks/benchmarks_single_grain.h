//multi grain cutting simulation using 5 tools, this function is used to start the simulations in section 5.2 of the IJMMS paper

//  temperature field can be sampled from a result file (interp_steady_temp boolean)
//  a result file can be read to initialize positions, useful to simulate a pre-cut but cooled down and de-stressed work-piece
